About this event
2030hub would like to invite you to join the second SDG Data Platform workshop to help co-create a project plan for 2022 and beyond to 2030.

Liverpool is at the forefront of this global sustainability data revolution and 2030hub wants to ensure we can nuture the most inclusive, creative, locally relevant and meaningful platform in the world.

We are hoping to expand on the discussions initiated in the first workshop around SDG data prioritisation and accessibility of the platform. [Click here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/liverpool-sdg-data-platform-2nd-working-group-meeting-tickets-264191412627) for tickets.
