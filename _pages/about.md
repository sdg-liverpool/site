## About the Sustainable Development Goals
The [Sustainable Development Goals](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDGs) are a universal call to action to:
- End poverty
- Protect the planet
- Improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere

The 17 Goals were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015, as part of the [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld).
