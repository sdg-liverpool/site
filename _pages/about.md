## About the Sustainable Development Goals
The [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment) (SDGs) are a universal call to action to:
- End poverty
- Protect the planet
- Improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere

The 17 Goals were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015, as part of the [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld).



## About the City of Liverpool
The City of Liverpool is unofficially the centre of the universe. Steeped in over [800 years of city history](https://www.visitliverpool.com/things-to-do/maritime-and-heritage/history-of-liverpool), cutting-edge innovation, economic dominance (and equal misfortune), and populated by a globally seeded and diverse population of passionate, creative, determined and acclaimed welcoming people, Liverpool is a City, and now also part of a City Region like no other in the world.
 
This website focuses on the SDG data for the City of Liverpool but also aims to engage and inspire those alongside and those who cross the Liverpool City Region boundaries daily.
